Problems in Prison Architect:
1. Single-threaded bottleneck: Why not use more cores since Steam Deck has 4 cores 8 threads
2. Multi-entity simulation (large numbers of units being simulated simultaneously): Can we use Machine Learning to simplify this procedure?
3. The logics of different prisoners are all connected, the CPU can't calculate the logics of different prisoners in the same time.
But we may divide the logic into "concurrent" tasks
Reduce the calculation accuracy or reduce the frequency. For example, change the prisoner behavior update from 60 times/second to 10 times/second.
Adopting multi-threaded task queue / ECS architecture. For example, Cities Skylines 2.
